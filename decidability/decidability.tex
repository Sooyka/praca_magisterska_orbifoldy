\chapter{Decidability}

\section{Algorithm}
Here we will show the proof that the problem of decideng whether a given rational number is in an 
Euler orbicharacteristic's spectrum or not is decidable by showing algorithm for doing this. \\
We start with $\frac{p}{q}$, where $p \in \mathbb{Z}$ and $q \in \mathbb{N}$.

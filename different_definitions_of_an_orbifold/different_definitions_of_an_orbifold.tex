\chapter{Different definitions of an orbifold}

We will explore various definitions of an orbifold, partially proving they are equivalent, partially 
linking to the sources. \\
Some of these definitions apply only to the special cases. Some of them contain constructions 
with which not all orbifolds can be made (at least some of them can't be derived as such a priori)
. \\

\section{Generalised manifolds}
This approuch is very simmilar to the previous one. It differs slightly where we put the 
difinition burden.

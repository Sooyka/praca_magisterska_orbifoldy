\begin{theorem}\label{speD_theorem}
Topology of $\speD$ is that of $\omega^\omega$. 
\end{theorem}

\textbf{Proof} \\
We will prove it by inductively constructing an order preserving homeomorphism $f$ between 
$\omega^\omega$ and $\speD$. \\
For simplycity, we will take reverse (decreasing) order on $\speD$ i.e. $1$ will be the smallest 
 element 
(so for example $0 > 1$ in this order)
% and in general $x < y $ in the ussual order iff $x > y$ in 
the reverse order).  \\

%Since $\speD$ is well ordered (as we know from \ref{well_order}) it has an order preserving 
%bijection with some ordinal number. 
We will inductively construct the family of order preserving homeomorphisms $f_\mu$, 
indexed by ordinal numbers less 
%or equal
\smalltodoII{fix this}
than 
$\omega^\omega$ each 
prefix of $\omega^\omega$ homeomorphic to $\nu + 1$ (so on all ordinals less 
or equal to $\nu$) 
and some prefix of $\speD$. We will construct them in such a way, that for any $\mu_1 < \mu_2 
< \omega^\omega$ function $f_{\mu_2}$ restricted to the ordinals less or equal to 
$\mu_1$ coincides with $f_{\mu_1}$.
Then we will take $f \coloneqq \bigcup\limits_{0 \leq \mu < 
\omega^\omega} f_\mu$ (so $f(\mu) \coloneqq f_\mu(\mu)$). \\
Our inductive assumption for a given $\mu$ will be that 
for all $\nu < \mu$ function $f_\nu$ will be an order preserving homeomorphism 
between prefix of $\omega^\omega$ homeomorphic to $\nu + 1$ (so on all ordinals less 
or equal to $\nu$) 
and some prefix of $\speD$ and that for every $\nu_1 < \nu_2 < \mu$ function $f_{\nu_2}$ 
restricted to the ordinals less or equal than $\nu_1$ coincides with $f_{\nu_1}$. \\ 
%Our inductive assumtion will be, that for all $\mu \leq \omega^\omega$ 
%function $f_\mu$ is a homeomorphism 
%between prefix of $\omega^\omega$ homeomorphic to $\mu$ and some \\
%$\bullet$ $\mu = 0$: Function $f_0$ is an empty function and as such it is an order preserving 
%homeomorphism. \\
$\bullet$ $\mu = 0$: We take $f_0$ as a function on $\{0\}$ taking value $1$. 
Both $0$ and $1$ are the smallest elements of, respectively, $\omega^\omega$ and $\speD$ 
so $f_0$ is defined between prefix of $\omega^\omega$ of all ordinals less or equal to $0$, and 
some prefix of $\speD$. 
Function $f_0$ also preserves order on one element set.
Function $f_0$ is an homeomorphism between one element sets, both with discreate topology. \\
$\bullet$ $\mu$ is a successor ordinal less than $\omega^\omega$: From an inductive assumption 
we have an order preserving homeomorphism $f_{\mu - 1}$ between all ordinals 
less or equal to $\mu - 1$ and some prefix of $\speD$. 
We define $f_\mu$ on all numbers less or equal to $\mu - 1$ to be equal $f_{\mu-1}$. \\
%Now we have two cases: \\ 
It remains to define $f_\mu(\mu)$. 
As $\speD$ is well ordered it is well defined to take successor of an element of $\speD$. 
We define $f_\mu(\mu)$ to be a succesor of $f_{\mu - 1}(\mu-1)$ in $\speD$. As such (and from 
inductive assumption) it is indeed defined as a function between prefix of $\omega^\omega$ of all 
ordinals less or equal to $\mu$, and 
some prefix of $\speD$.
\\
Now we want to prove, that $f_\mu$ preservse the order. From the inductive assumption 
it preserves the order up to $\mu - 1$. As $\mu$ is the successor of $\mu - 1$ and 
$f_\mu(\mu)$ is a successor of $f_\mu(\mu-1)$, we have that $f_\mu$ is indeed an order preserving 
function. \\
Now we want to prove that $f_\mu$ is a homeomorphism. As from inductive assumtion we know, 
that $f_{\mu - 1}$ was a homeomorphism it is sufficient to show that preimages of open 
sets containing $f_\mu(\mu)$ and images of open sets containing $\mu$ are open. \\
Since $f_\mu(\mu)$ is a successor and since $\speD$ is well ordered, we have, that $f_\mu(\mu)$ 
is an isolated point in $\speD$. \\
Simmilarly $\mu$ is an isolated point in $\mu + 1$ as an successor ordinal. \\
From this we have, that open sets containing $f_\mu(\mu)$ (resp. $\mu$) are of the form 
$U \cup \{f_\mu(\mu)\}$ (resp. $V \cup \{\mu\}$) for some $U$ -- open set in $\speD$. 
(resp. $V$ -- open set in $\mu + 1$).
%Holding the notation of $U$ and $V$ we have that $f_\mu[V] = $
\smalltodoII{może rozwinąć}
From this this is clear. \\

$\bullet$ $\mu$ is a limit ordinal less than $\omega^\omega$:  
%\todo{net and so on}
From the inductive assumption, for each $\nu < \mu$ we have an order preserving homeomorphism 
$f_\nu$ on the ordinals less or equal to $\nu$ and those functions pairwise coincide 
on the intersections 
of their domains. For every ordinal $\nu < \mu$ we define 
$f_\mu(\nu) \coloneqq f_\nu(\nu)$. It remains to define $f_\mu(\mu)$. \\
We consider a net $\phi_\nu \coloneqq \{f_\nu(\nu)\}_{\nu<\mu} \subset \mathbb{R}$
%, indexed by all $\nu < \mu$
. From the inductive assumption we know that the domain of the net $\phi_\nu$, as 
well as it's image is well ordered and that the net $\phi_\nu$.  
is an order preserving homeomorphism.
% is  this is a well ordered net. \todo{napisać jakoś lepiej tę własność}
Now we will show that the net $\phi_\nu$ has a limit in $\speD$. \\
First we will show, that $\phi_\nu$ has a limit in $\mathbb{R}$. For this, we will show that 
$\phi_\nu$ is bounded. \\
Order type of the image of $\phi_\nu$ is equal to $\mu$ and it is a prefix of $\speD$. 

As we have \ref{accumulation_points_of_the_set} 
As $\mathbb{R}$ is Hausdorff, from \cite{Kelley1975} (chapter 2, 
theorem 3, page 67) we know, that .

For the sake of contradiction, let us assume, that $\phi_\nu$ is unbounded. \\
There exist $n$ such that $\phi_\nu < \omega^n$. \\
The only unbounded in $\mathbb{R}$ prefix of $\speD$ is a whole $\speD$. \\ 
From this we conclude that $\speD$ schould have order type of $\omega^\omega$.
\\ 
%Firstly we will determine the order type of $\speD$. 
%From the lemma \ref{well_order} we know, that $\speD$ is well ordered, so it has order type 
%of some ordinal number. From this and 
%from the theorem \ref{greatest \apots} we know, that for the point $1-\frac{n}{2}$ there exist 
%a neighborhood $U=(1-\frac{n}{2}-\varepsilon,1-\frac{n}{2}+\varepsilon)$ such that $U \cap 
%\speD$ is homeomorphic to $\omega^n$. From this, and again from theorem \ref{greatest \apots} 
%we have that $\speD \cap [1,1-\frac{n}{2})$ is homeomorphic with $\omega^n$. 
%From this $\speD$ is homeomorphic with $\omega^\omega$.

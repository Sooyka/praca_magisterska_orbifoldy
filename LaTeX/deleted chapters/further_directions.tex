\section{Asked, but unanswered questions}
Our ultimate goal is to give the answer to the questions such as: \\
- For a given $x \in \sigma$, how many orbifolds have $x$ as their \Eoc?\\
- Why? Is there some underlying geometrical reason for that?\\
- Can we characterise points $x \in \sigma$ that has the most orbifolds corresponding to them? \\
- Is there any reasonable normalisation to counter the effect that there are 'more' 
points as we go 
to lesser values. (What we mean by 'more' was sted in) \\
The first equstion we can tackle is steaming from the chapter \ref{order structure} 
and it is -- Do $\speD$ and $\speS$ coincide? It is easy to answer that $\speD \neq \speS$ 
(and we will do that along some harder questions in the moment), but do they coincide 
starting from a sufficiently distant point? Or maybe, for every denominator, do they coincide 
from a sufficiently distatn point? (Yes.) \\

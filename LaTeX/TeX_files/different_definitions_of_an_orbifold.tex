\chapter{Different definitions of an orbifold}

This chapter the next will be a technical chapters. Later on we will evoke some terms and 
definitions without 
explicitly saying what they mean instead we will put a reference to this chapter with explicit 
saying to what definition it refers. \\
For example in the later chapters there will be phrases like "adding a defect of order $\dots$" or 
"gluying orbifolds by boundries" and they are explained in this and the next chapter.
 

We will explore various definitions of an orbifold, partially proving they are equivalent, partially 
linking to the sources. \\
Some of these definitions apply only to the special cases. Some of them contain constructions 
with which not all orbifolds can be made (at least some of them can't be derived as such a priori)
. \\

\section{Generalised manifolds}
This approuch is very simmilar to the previous one. It differs slightly where we put the 
difinition burden.

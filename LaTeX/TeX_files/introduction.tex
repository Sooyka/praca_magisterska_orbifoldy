\section{Technical introductions}
Now, we will proceed to give technical introductions about orbifolds, \Eoc and the 
technics we will use in this thesis, alongside with some definitions and notation and 
naming conventions.  
\section{Orbifolds}
\todo{jak sie juz wszystko zbierze co ma tu być, to to dopisać}
The definition of the orbifold is taken from Thurston \cite{Thurston1979} (chapter 13). 
We briefly recall the concept, but for full discussion we refer to \cite{Thurston1979}. \\
An orbifold is a generalisation of a manifold. One allows more variety of local behaviour. 
On a manifold a map is a homeomorphism between $\mathbb{R}^n$ and some open set on a manifold. 
On an orbifold a map is a homeomorphism between a quotient of $\mathbb{R}^n$ by some 
finite group and some open set on an orbifold. 
In addition to that, the orbifold structure consist the informations about that finite group 
and a quotient map for any such open set. 

Above definition says that an orbifold is locally homeomorphic do the quotient of $\mathbb{R}^n$ 
by some finite group. 

When an orbifold as a whole is quotient of some finite group acting on a manifold we say, that 
it is 'good'. Otherwise we say, that it is 'bad'. 

We are also adopting notation from \cite{Thurston1979}. 

In two dimentions there are only four types of bad orbifolds, namely: \\
- $S^2(n)$ \\
- $D^2(;n)$ \\
- $S^2(n_1,n_2)$ for $n_1 < n_2$ \\
- $D^2(;n_1,n_2)$ for $n_1 < n_2$. \\
All other orbifolds are good.
As manifolds are special case of orbifolds with all ...
We differ from Thurston in the terms of naming points with maps with non-trivial groups. 
We call them orbipoints. If the group acts as the group of rotations (so a 
cyclic group) we call them rotational points. If the group is a dihedreal group we call them 
dihedreal points. And if it is point on the boundry that stabilises relfecition it is a 
reflection point.

Map between orbifolds can be defined as follows:

\section{Definition and properties of order of accumulation points}
\label{accumulation_points_definitions} 
%\todo{zmienić to wszystko na rangę cantora bendiksona}
%We start with one technical definition of "transitive order" that will be almost what we want
%and then, there will be the the definition of "order", which is the definition that we need.
%\begin{definition}
%(Inductive). 
%%We say, that the point $a$  from the topological space $X$ is an acccumulation 
%%point of the transitive order 0, when
%We say that the point is an acccumulation point of a transitive order $0$, when it is 
%an isolated point. 
%We say that the point is an acccumulation point of a transitive order $n + 1$, when it is 
%an acccumulation point (in the usual sense) of the accumulation points of the transitive 
%order $n$. 
%\end{definition}  
%The only issue of the above definition is that the point of the transitive order $n$ 
%is also a point 
%of the transitive order $k$, for all $0< k \leq n$. We want a definition of order such that 
%for any point, there is at most one integer that is its order. So we define:
%\begin{definition}
%We say that the point is an acccumulation point of order $n$ iff it is an acccumulation point 
%of the transitive order $n$ and it is not an acccumulation point of the transitive order $n+1$. 
%If the point is an acccumulation point of the transitive order for an arbitrary large 
%$n$ we say that 
%the  point is an acccumulation point of order $\omega$.
%\end{definition}

%Corespondence between accumulation points and cantor bendixon derivative are describen 
%in appendix \smalltodoII{link to appendix}. 
We start with definition of being "at least of order $n$" that will be almost what we want
and then, there will be the definition of being "order", which is the definition that we need. \\
For a given set we define as follows:
\begin{definition}
(Inductive). 
%We say, that the point $a$  from the topological space $X$ is an acccumulation 
%point of the transitive order 0, when
We say that the point $x$ is an acccumulation point of a set $X$ 
of order at least $0$, when it belongs to the set $X$. 
We say that the point $x$ is an acccumulation point of a set 
of order at least $n + 1$, when it is 
an acccumulation point (in the usual sense) of the accumulation points each of order at least 
$n$ i.e. in every neighbourhood of $x$ there is at least one accumulation point of a set $X$ 
of order at least $n$, distincs from $x$. 
\end{definition}  
%The only issue of the above definition is that the point of the transitive order $n$ 
%is also a point 
%of the transitive order $k$, for all $0< k \leq n$. We want a definition of order such that 
%for any point, there is at most one integer that is its order. So we define:
\begin{definition}
We say that the point is an acccumulation point of order $n$ iff it is an acccumulation point 
of order at least $n$ and it is not an acccumulation point of order at least $n+1$. 
If the point is an acccumulation point of order at least $n$ for an arbitrary large 
$n$ we say that 
the point is an acccumulation point of order $\omega$.
\end{definition}
When we will say that a point is an accumulation point of some set without specifying an order 
then we will mean being an accumulation point in the ussual sense; from the point of view 
of above definitions, that is, an accumulation point of order at least one.

\section{Notation}

"feature"

We treat manifolds and orbifolds as a sphere with some features added by the operations.

We will regard parts of that notation not only as features on an orbifold but also as an operations 
on orbifolds transforming one to another by adding particular feature. \\
We will denote the difference in Euler characteristic which is made by modifying 
an orbifold by such a feature as $\Delta(modification)$.

If not stated othewise, in the expressions containing $\infty$ symbol, their value is understood 
as $\varphi(\infty) \coloneqq \lim\limits_{n\to \infty}\varphi(n)$.

\section{Spectra}
This will be the main interest of this thesis. $\spe$. dadada
The form of the spectrum of two dimensional $M$ orbifold is:
For a manifold $M$ with $h$ handles, $c$ cross-cups and $b$ boundary components, it's 
Euler characteristic is given by:
\begin{equation}
\chi(M) = 2-2h-c-b.
\end{equation}
The possible $\Delta$ for possible orbifold features are:\\
$\bullet$ for $b\neq 0$:
\begin{equation}
\{-\frac{n-1}{2n}\ \big|\ n\in\mathbb{N}_{>0}\cup \{\infty\}\}
\end{equation}
$\bullet$ for $b = 0$:
\begin{equation}
\{-\frac{n-1}{n}\ \big|\ n\in\mathbb{N}_{>0}\cup \{\infty\}\}.
\end{equation} 
%with the convention, that $\varphi(\infty) \coloneqq \lim\limits_{k\to \infty} \varphi(k)$.

Thus, we have that:\\
$\bullet$ for $b\neq 0$: 
\begin{equation}
\spe(M) = 2-2h-c-b - \left\{\sum\limits_{i=1}^n\frac{d_i-1}{2d_i}\ 
\big|\ n\in\mathbb{N}_0,\ d_i\in\mathbb{N}_{>0}\cup \{\infty\}\right\}
\end{equation}
$\bullet$ for $b = 0$:
\begin{equation}
\spe(M) = 2-2h-c - \left\{\sum\limits_{i=1}^n \frac{r_i-1}{r_i}\ \big|\ n\in\mathbb{N}_0,\ 
r_i\in\mathbb{N}_{>0}\cup \{\infty\}\right\}.
\end{equation} 
\label{two dim manifold spectrum}


\begin{observation}\label{2times homeomorphism}
We have that $\speS = 2\speD$.
\end{observation}
\textbf{Proof.}\\

Indeed, since: 
\begin{align}
\spe(S^2) = 2 -\left\{\sum\limits_{i=1}^n \frac{r_i-1}{r_i}\ \big|\ n\in\mathbb{N}_0,\ 
r_i\in\mathbb{N}_{>0}\cup \{\infty\}\right\}
\end{align}
and 
\begin{align}
\spe(D^2) = 1 - \left\{\sum\limits_{j=1}^m\frac{d_j-1}{2d_j}\ 
\big|\ m\in\mathbb{N}_0,\ d_j\in\mathbb{N}_{>0}\cup \{\infty\}\right\}._\square
\end{align}

\begin{observation}\label{all_spectra_are_isomorphic}\label{spe_M}
For every two dimentional manifold $M$, we have that $\spe(M)$ is homeomorphic to $\speD$. 
For $M$ with $h$ handles, $c$ cross-cups and $b$ boundary components, this homeomorphism is: \\
$\bullet$ for $b \neq 0$:
\begin{equation}
\spe(M) = \speD - 2h - c - (b - 1), 
\end{equation}
$\bullet$ for $b = 0$:
\begin{equation}
\spe(M) = 2\speD - 2h - c.
\end{equation}  
\end{observation}

%Ok, all isomorphic with $\speD$ \\
%here write about it \\
%Tell me about it!
\textbf{Proof.} \\
For a manifold $M$ with $h$ handles, $c$ cross-cups and $b$ boundary components, it's 
$\spebr{M}$ is given by:\\
$\bullet$ for $b\neq 0$: 
\begin{equation}
\spe(M) = 2-2h-c-b - \left\{\sum\limits_{i=1}^n\frac{d_i-1}{2d_i}\ 
\big|\ n\in\mathbb{N}_0,\ d_i\in\mathbb{N}_{>0}\cup \{\infty\}\right\}
\end{equation}
$\bullet$ for $b = 0$:
\begin{equation}
\spe(M) = 2-2h-c - \left\{\sum\limits_{i=1}^n \frac{r_i-1}{r_i}\ \big|\ n\in\mathbb{N}_0,\ 
r_i\in\mathbb{N}_{>0}\cup \{\infty\}\right\}.
\end{equation} 

On the other hand, we have that:
\begin{equation}
\speD = 1-\left\{\sum\limits_{i=1}^n\frac{d_i-1}{2d_i}\ 
\big|\ n\in\mathbb{N}_0,\ d_i\in\mathbb{N}_{>0}\cup \{\infty\}\right\}
\end{equation}
\begin{equation}
\speS = 2 - \left\{\sum\limits_{i=1}^n \frac{r_i-1}{r_i}\ \big|\ n\in\mathbb{N}_0,\ 
r_i\in\mathbb{N}_{>0}\cup \{\infty\}\right\}
\end{equation}
and
\begin{equation}
\speS = 2\speD.
\end{equation}
From this, the observation follows immedietly. $_\square$

\section{Egyptian franctions}
Egyptian frantion is a finite sum of fractions, all with numerators one. 
Most of the time it is also required, that the fractions in the sum have pairwise distinct 
denominators. We will however take less usual convention and will drop that requirement, 
calling an egyptian fraction any sum of unitary fractions. 
%\section{Translating questions to ones about Egyptian fractions}\label{Egyptian_fractions}
\section{Connection between spectra and Egyptian fractions}\label{Egyptian_fractions}
The terms $-\frac{r_i-1}{r_i}$ in the sum \ref{chi orb expression rotational} 
can be expressed as $-1+ \frac{1}{r_i}$ 
and the term $-\frac{d_j-1}{2d_j}$ in the sum \ref{chi orb expression dihedral} can be expressed as 
$-\frac{1}{2} + \frac{1}{2d_j}$. 
Then the sums become:
\begin{equation}\label{Egyptian S2 sum}
\chi(M) - n + \underbrace{\sum_{i=1}^n \frac{1}{r_i}}_{
\substack{\textrm{Egyptian} \\ \textrm{fraction}}}
\end{equation}
and
\begin{equation}\label{Egyptian D2 sum}
\chi(M) - \frac{m}{2} + \frac{1}{2}
\underbrace{\sum_{j=1}^m \frac{1}{d_j}}_{
\substack{\textrm{Egyptian} \\\textrm{fraction}}}.
\end{equation}

%In expressions there are 
In this form, the egyptian fractions are explicitly present in expresions of 
points in $\spebr{M}$.
%This is very simmilar to the notion of the egyptian franction, 
%which is a rational number expressed as a sum of a fractions with numerator $1$ and 
%different denominators. Sometimes the "distinct denominators" condition is dropped and we are 
%following that convention in this thesis. 

The $-n$ and $-\frac{m}{2}$ terms provide constraints on the number of fractions that 
can apprear in the sum.
%The particular interest is in translating questions related to spectra to the questions 
%of egyptian franctions. 
%What the data of the spectra imposes is the number of fractions to be summed. 

%We are interested in translating 
We will now translate the questions of being in the spectrum 
to the questions of being expressable as egyptian fraction with the particular number 
of summands. It will be used in \ref{saturation theorem} and \ref{unboundness}.

%We can make following corollaries:
%\begin{corollary}\label{from Egyptian fractions}
%If $x$ can be expressed as an egyptian fraction with $n$ summands, then 
%\begin{equation}
%2 - n + x \in \speS
%\end{equation}
%and
%\begin{equation}
%1 - \frac{n}{2} + \frac{x}{2} \in \speD.
%\end{equation}
%\end{corollary}
%\begin{corollary}
%If $y \in \speS$ as an \Eoc of an orbifold which all orbipoints are $n$ rotational orbipoints, 
%then 
%\begin{equation}
%y + n - 2
%\end{equation} 
%can be expressed as an egyptian fraction with $n$ 
%(not nessecerely distincs) summands. 
%
%If $y \in \speD$ as an \Eoc of an orbifold which all orbipoints are $m$ rotational orbipoints, 
%then \begin{equation}
%2y + \frac{m}{2} - 1
%\end{equation}
%can be expressed as an egyptian fraction with $m$ 
%(not nessecerely distincs) summands. 
%\end{corollary}
%We may now expand our corollaries about egyptian fractions to arbitrary $M$:

We will now state two corrolaries that follows immediately from the 
form of expressions \ref{Egyptian S2 sum} and \ref{Egyptian D2 sum}, and from 
\ref{two dim manifold spectrum}.
\begin{corollary}\label{from Egyptian fractions M}
If $x$ can be expressed as an egyptian fraction with $n$ summands, then for any two dimensional 
manifold $M$ we have: 
\begin{equation}
\chi(M) - n + x \in \spebr{M}
\end{equation}
and, if $M$ has at least one boundary component also:
\begin{equation}
\chi(M) - \frac{n}{2} + \frac{1}{2}x \in \spebr{M}.
\end{equation}
\end{corollary}
\begin{corollary}\label{to egyptian fractions M}
If for some two dimensional manifold $M$ we have that $y \in \spebr{M}$ as an \Eoc\ of 
an orbifold which has $n$ rotational orbipoints and not any other, 
then 
\begin{equation}
y + n - \chi(M)
\end{equation} 
can be expressed as an egyptian fraction with $n$ 
(not nessecerely distincs) summands. 

If for some two dimensional manifold $M$ with at least one boundary component 
we have that $y \in \spebr{M}$ as an \Eoc of an orbifold which has $m$ dihedral orbipoints and 
not any other, 
then 
\begin{equation}
2y + \frac{m}{2} - 2\chi(M)
\end{equation}
can be expressed as an egyptian fraction with $m$ 
(not nessecerely distincs) summands. 
\end{corollary}

\section{Operations and constructions on orbifolds}\label{Operations}
Write about the general operations we are interested in i.e. taking any number of features (handles 
cross caps, parts of boundry components with orbipoints on it, orbipoints in the interior) and
replacing it by any other feauters
(Some preserve the area)
Write about operations nesseserie for reduction of cases
write that every operation reduces \Eoc.

\label{moving from interior to boundary}


\section{Questions asked}
There will be two main parts of question: 

$\bullet$ Ones regarding $\spe$ as a set, where we will be asking 
of its order type and topology and relation to other sets such as $\speD$ and $\speS$. 
We will focus on these questions in \ref{order structure}. 

$\bullet$ Ones regarding $\spe$ as an image of a $\chi^{orb}$, sending orbifolds to their \Eoc s. 
There, we will ask for example how namy orbifolds have particular \Eoc\ and 
related questions. We will focus on these questions in the chapter \ref{counting occurrences}.

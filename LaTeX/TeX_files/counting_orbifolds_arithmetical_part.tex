\chapter{Counting orbifolds -- arithmetical part}\label{Counting orbifolds -- arithmetical part}


%\section{Arithmetical part}

%We want to determine this $n$. If $n = 0$, then $\frac{p}{q}$ is not in $\sigma$. 
%If $n > 0$, then $$
%\subsection{Deciding number of occurences}
%Searching for all occurences 

%The difficulty here is to carefully step other an occurence. 

%Compared to the previous version, we also use an occurance counter, starting with it set to 0 
%and with the list of orbifolds, wich is empty at the start.

This will be an extention of the algorithm from \ref{}. 

\begin{lstlisting}[firstnumber=1,consecutivenumbers=true]
In the case, the flag is set to: 
{
    "Less", then 
    {
        We increase the pivot counter by one ($b_c \coloneqq b_c + 1$).
        If $b_c = 2$ and the values of all the counters 
        on the left are also equal 2 then 
        {
            We end the whole algorithm with the answer "no".
        }
        We set the value of all counters on the left to $b_c$
        If $\chi^{orb}(*b_1b_2b_3\dots)=\frac{p}{q}$ then
        {
            We found an orbifold, we add it to a list 
            and increase the occurence counter by 1. 
            We set the flag to "Less".
            We put pivot to the $c+1$ counter.
            We go to the line 1..

\section{Why this works}

\section{Implementation}\label{implementation}
As an appendix in the separate document, there is a source of a program with implementation 
of this algorithm 
with full  
enhancments described in this chapter. It is written in Rust. 
It can be also found on \smalltodoII{daÄ‡ ref do github} along with the \LaTeX\ source of 
this thesis.
%It is in the separate file, as it would take too much space in this 
%document and wouldn't be readable.

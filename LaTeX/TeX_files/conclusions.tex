\chapter{Conclusions}

We described the spectrum of possible \Eoc s of two dimentional orbifolds. 
It has topology of $\omega^\omega$ and the problem, whether the given point is in the 
spectrum is desidable. \\

We also provided some finitess results, such as that there are always only finately many 
orbifolds for a given \Eoc. So the problem how much are for a given number is also decidable.\\

From \smalltodo{referencja} we know, that there are howe ver, blab la dowolnie du≈ºo na \Eoc. \\

It remains unclear how Disk spectrum and Sphere spcectrum lies relative to each other, 
but some result was, shown, namely, that every accumulation point of Sphere spectum
is also in the disk spectrum.

%Order type with zanurzenie w R
%
%1537/137
%

In this chapter we will discuss that both the order type and the topology 
of the set $\spe$ of all possible Euler orbicharacteristics 
of two-dimensional orbifolds are that of $\omega^\omega$. 
%We will call this set $\spe$.
%We will see (in the observation \ref{boils_down}) that the problem of determining this boils
% down to the 
% analysis of all 
%the possible 
%values of the expressions:
%\begin{equation}
%2 - \sum_{i=1}^n \frac{I_i-1}{I_i}
%\end{equation}
%and 
%\begin{equation}
%1 - \sum_{j=1}^m \frac{b_j-1}{2b_j},
%\end{equation}
%where $I_i, b_j$ varies over $\mathbb{N}_{>0} \cup \{\infty\}$. \\
%As
%\begin{equation}
%2 - \sum_{i=1}^n \frac{I_i-1}{I_i} = 2 - n + \sum_{i=1}^n \frac{1}{I_i}
%\end{equation}
%and 
%\begin{equation}
%1 - \sum_{j=1}^m \frac{b_j-1}{2b_j} = 1 - m + \sum_{j=1}^m \frac{1}{2b_j},
%\end{equation}
%some questions about the spectrum are equivalent to some regarding Egyptian fractions. 
%More on this connection is discussed in \ref{Egyptian_fractions}.

%\textbf{Disclaimer}\\
For now, until chapter \ref{counting occurrences} named "Counting occurrences", 
we will not pay attention 
to how many orbifolds have the same Euler orbicharacteristic, only whether a particular 
number is an \Eoc\ for at least one orbifold or not. 
%Let us note, that 
%Euler orbicharacteristic does not depend on the cyclic order of points on 
%the components of the boundary. 
%Because of that and since Euler orbicharacteristic does not depend on the cyclic order 
%of points on the components of the boundary we introduce an extension of a notation from 
%\cite{Conway2008}. 

%%We will write $\ast \{a,b,c,d,\cdots\}$ to denote not a particular orbifold, but a type 
%%of orbifold that have a dihedral points on a component of the boundry of orders 
%$a,b,c,d,\cdots$, but 
%%in any order. \\ 

%We will write $\ast \{a,b,c,d,\cdots\}$ to denote a type of a boundary (of an orbifold) that have 
%kaleidoscopic points of periods $a,b,c,d,\cdots$, but in any order. \\


%From what we wrote above (that Euler orbicharacteristic does not depend on the cyclic order 
%of points on the components of the boundary), we can see that Euler 
%orbicharacteristic is well defined 
%%on such types of orbifolds. \\ 
%when we specify only such a type of the components of the boundary of an orbifold and not 
%a particular cyclic order.  \\

\section{Reductions of cases}
In this section we want to make some reductions to 
limit number of cases that we will be dealing with. 

We aim to find a minimal set $B$ of base manifolds that "covers all the cases" i.e. $B$ 
such that any for any $x \in \spe$ there 
is an orbifold $O$ with a base manifold from $B$ such that $\cho{O} = x$.
%We aim to limit the number of base manifolds as much as possible while keeping entire spectrum. 
It will turn out that $B = \{S^2, D^2\}$ and there are
% it can be done such that we are left with $B = \{S^2, D^2\}$ and there is 
no futher reductions possible. 

%For this chapter we will consider orbifolds according to a definition from 
%(\ref{Disk_and_sphere_with_defects}). \\
Given an orbifold $O_1$, we want to perform some operations from \ref{Operations} on it, such that the resulting orbifold 
$O_2$ will have the same Euler orbicharactristic, but the base manifold of $O_2$ would have as 
big Euler characteristic as possible. 

The Euler orbicharacteristic of base manifold depends only on the number of handles, cross caps 
and boundry components. And, as stated in \ref{E_orb} it is: 
\begin{equation}
2-2h-c-b
\end{equation}
\smalltodoII{opisać i wybrać oznaczenia}

For ever such a manifold feature we want to find an orbifold features with the same 
Euler orbicharacteristic delta.  

%To do this we want to eliminate handles 
%Let us observe, that:
One of the ways to do that is by observing that:
\begin{align}
\hspace{3cm}\Delta(\circ) =& \hspace{-1cm} &-2& \hspace{-1cm} &= \Delta(\ast (^\ast 2)^4) \\
\hspace{3cm}\Delta(\ast) =& \hspace{-1cm} &-1& \hspace{-1cm} &= \Delta((^\ast 2)^4) \\
\hspace{3cm}\Delta(\times) =& \hspace{-1cm} &-1& \hspace{-1cm} &= \Delta((^\ast 2)^4)
\end{align}
So we see that from any orbifold we can eradicate handles ....       
\begin{align}
\hspace{3cm}\Delta(n) =& \hspace{-1cm} &\frac{n-1}{n}& \hspace{-1cm} 
&= \Delta((^\ast n)^2)\label{third_reduction}
\end{align}

%\begin{align}
%\Delta(n) =& &\frac{n-1}{n}&  
%&= \Delta((^\ast n)^2)\label{third_reduction}
%\end{align}

From this we can conclude that every Euler orbicharacteristic can be obtained 
by an orbifold with base manifold $S^2$ or $D^2$. 
Examples of rational numbers from $\speS \setminus \speD$ and $\speD \setminus \speS$ are:
We will provide examples 
Futher examination of connections between $\speD$ and $\speS$ is performed in \ref{D_and_S}.
%\ref{counting_occurences}

%From this we can conclude, that every Euler orbicharacteristic can be obtained 
%by an orbifold of signature of a type ($n$ and $m$ are arbitrary):

%\begin{align*}
%I_1I_2\cdots I_n & \textrm{\ or} \\
%\ast b_1b_2\cdots b_m &.
%\end{align*}

%Let us denote the set of all possible Euler orbicharacteristics of orbifolds of the form 
%$I_1I_2\cdots I_n$ by $\speS$ and the set 
%of all possible Euler orbicharacteristics of orbifolds of the form $\ast b_1b_2\cdots b_m$ 
%as $\speD$. 
%So we have that $\spe = \speD \cup \speS$. \\
%% Let us denote the set of all possible \Eoc s of two-dimentional orbifolds as $\spe$. \\
%Let us also observe that the order type and topology of $\speS$ and $\speD$ are 
%the same since 

%\begin{equation}\label{times_two_fact}
%2\speD=\speS
%\end{equation}
%and multiplying by $2$ is the order preserving homeomorphism of $\mathbb{R}$. \\[16pt]

%Now we can make aforementioned observation:
\todo{dopisać to czytelniej}
w szeczgólności żeby było jasne jaką redukcję robimy
The result of our reductions, can be expressed as:

In the terms of set relations:
\begin{observation}\label{sum of spectras}
If two-dimentional manifold $M$ has no boundry, then
%\begin{equation} 
%\spe{M} = \chi(M) - (\speS - 2) 
%\end{equation}
%and
\begin{equation} 
\spebr{M} \subseteq \speS 
\end{equation} 

If, in addition, $M \neq S^2$, then 
\begin{equation} 
\spebr{M} \subseteq \speD. 
\end{equation}

\end{observation}
%\textbf{Proof} \\
%Let $M$ be a two-dimentional manifold with no boundry, from \ref{\Eoc_as_a_sum} we have, that: 
%\begin{equation}
%\spe{M} = \{\chi(M) - \sum_{i=1}^n 
%\frac{I_i-1}{I_i}\ |\ n \in \mathbb{N} \land \forall_i I_i \in \mathbb{N} \cup \infty\}.
%\end{equation}
%And from 
%$\chi(M) - (\speS - 2)$
\begin{observation}
If two-dimentional manifold  $M$ has a boundry, then 
%\begin{equation}
%\spe{M} = \chi(M) + (\speD - 1)
%\end{equation}
%and 
\begin{equation}
\spebr{M} \subseteq \speD
\end{equation}
\end{observation}
%\textbf{Proof} \\
%\begin{equation}
%\{\chi(M) - \sum_{j=1}^m 
%\frac{b_j-1}{2b_j}\ |\ m \in \mathbb{N} \land \forall_j b_j \in \mathbb{N} \cup \infty\} 
%\end{equation}
%\begin{observation}
%If two-dimentional manifold  $M$ has no boundry, then $\spe{M} \subseteq \speS$. 
%If, in addition, $M \neq S^2$, then 
%$\spe{M} \subseteq \speD$.
%\end{observation}
%\begin{observation}
%If two-dimentional manifold  $M$ has a boundry, then $\spe{M} \subseteq \speD$.
%\end{observation}

In the terms of arithmetical expressions:
\todo{sums are the form od sped and spes}
\begin{observation}\label{boils_down}
From above reductions we can conclued that our problem boiles down to the analysis of all
 the possible 
values of the expressions:
\begin{equation}\label{S2_sum}
2 - \sum_{i=1}^n \frac{I_i-1}{I_i}
\end{equation}
and 
\begin{equation}
1 - \sum_{j=1}^m \frac{b_j-1}{2b_j},
\end{equation}
with $I_i$ and $b_j$ ranging over $\mathbb{N}_{>0}\cup \{\infty\}$.
%, with a convention 
%that $\varphi(\infty) \coloneqq \lim\limits_{k\to \infty} \varphi(k)$. 
\end{observation}
As stated in \ref{cusp_reduction} we can perform futher reductions to have an orbifold with 
particular orbicharacteristic without cusps (if needed) and then (after these reductions) 
we can analyse only expressions with $I_i$ and $b_j$ ranging over $\mathbb{N}_{>0}$ and 
they will still give us full spectrum. 

However, as stated later, it will be more convenient to us to include orbifolds with cusps 
so we are stating above remark only for readers information. 

The fact that it agrees with the definition of the \Eoc\ on the geometrical terms was 
addressed in \ref{extended_Euler_orbicharacteristic}. 



To determine order type and topology of $\spe$ we will first study how $\speD$ looks like. 
Then, remembering that 
$\spe = \speS \cup \speD$ and $\speS = 2\speD$ we will make an argument for $\spe$. 

%We also have shown that all possible \Eoc s are achieved without using cusps. As such, 
%we will use 
%cusps, remembering, that we can always get rid of them, if needed. So above $I_i$ and $b_j$ 
%are ranging over $\mathbb{N}_{>0}\cup \{\infty\}$, where expressions for infinity are defined as 
%a limits. The fact that it agrees with the definition of the \Eoc\ on the geometrical terms was 
%addressed in \ref{extended_Euler_orbicharacteristic}. \\
%Here is the notation that will be used: \\
%$\spe$ - spectrum of all possible \Eoc\ of two-dimentional orbifolds \\
%$\spe{M}$ - spectrum of all possible \Eoc\ of $M$ orbifolds \\

%% We would like to make some more observations concerning subsets of $\spe$. 
%% For any two-dimentional manifold $M$, observe, that:

%Now we state what we can already conclude. 


%\begin{theorem}\label{all_spectra_are_isomorphic}
%For any two two-dimentional manifolds $M$, $N$ spectras $\spe{M}$ and $\speM(N)$ have the same 
%order type and topology. 
%\end{theorem}
%\textbf{Proof} \\



\section{Order type and topology of $\speD$}


In this section we will also describe precisely where accumulation points of $\speD$ lie and of 
 which order 
(see below \ref{accumulation_points_definitions}) they are. Analysis of locations of those 
accumulation points, as interesting as it is alone will also be necessery for providing 
our argument about order type and topology of $\speD$. 
\subsection{Definition and properties of order of accumulation points}
\label{accumulation_points_definitions} 
\todo{zmienić to wszystko na rangę cantora bendiksona}
%We start with one technical definition of "transitive order" that will be almost what we want
%and then, there will be the the definition of "order", which is the definition that we need.
%\begin{definition}
%(Inductive). 
%%We say, that the point $a$  from the topological space $X$ is an acccumulation 
%%point of the transitive order 0, when
%We say that the point is an acccumulation point of a transitive order $0$, when it is 
%an isolated point. 
%We say that the point is an acccumulation point of a transitive order $n + 1$, when it is 
%an acccumulation point (in the usual sense) of the accumulation points of the transitive 
%order $n$. 
%\end{definition}  
%The only issue of the above definition is that the point of the transitive order $n$ 
%is also a point 
%of the transitive order $k$, for all $0< k \leq n$. We want a definition of order such that 
%for any point, there is at most one integer that is its order. So we define:
%\begin{definition}
%We say that the point is an acccumulation point of order $n$ iff it is an acccumulation point 
%of the transitive order $n$ and it is not an acccumulation point of the transitive order $n+1$. 
%If the point is an acccumulation point of the transitive order for an arbitrary large 
%$n$ we say that 
%the  point is an acccumulation point of order $\omega$.
%\end{definition}
We start with definition of being "at least of order $n$" that will be almost what we want
and then, there will be the definition of being "order", which is the definition that we need. \\
For a given set we define as follows:
\begin{definition}
(Inductive). 
%We say, that the point $a$  from the topological space $X$ is an acccumulation 
%point of the transitive order 0, when
We say that the point $x$ is an acccumulation point of a set $X$ 
of order at least $0$, when it belongs to the set $X$. 
We say that the point $x$ is an acccumulation point of a set 
of order at least $n + 1$, when it is 
an acccumulation point (in the usual sense) of the accumulation points each of order at least 
$n$ i.e. in every neighbourhood of $x$ there is at least one accumulation point of a set $X$ 
of order at least $n$, distincs from $x$. 
\end{definition}  
%The only issue of the above definition is that the point of the transitive order $n$ 
%is also a point 
%of the transitive order $k$, for all $0< k \leq n$. We want a definition of order such that 
%for any point, there is at most one integer that is its order. So we define:
\begin{definition}
We say that the point is an acccumulation point of order $n$ iff it is an acccumulation point 
of order at least $n$ and it is not an acccumulation point of order at least $n+1$. 
If the point is an acccumulation point of order at least $n$ for an arbitrary large 
$n$ we say that 
the point is an acccumulation point of order $\omega$.
\end{definition}
When we will say that a point is an accumulation point of some set without specifying an order 
then we will mean being an accumulation point in the ussual sense; from the point of view 
of above definitions, that is, an accumulation point of order at least one.

\subsection{Analysis of locations of accumulation points of $\speD$ with respect to their order}
%\subsubsection{Some preliminary observations}
We want to determine where exactly are accumulation points of the set $\speD$ with 
respect to their orders. 

For this we will use  
a handful of observations and lemmas. 
\begin{observation}\label{accumulation_points_are_in_the_spectrum}
Let us observe, that $\lim\limits_{n \to \infty} \Delta(^\ast n) = -\frac{1}{2}$. From that, 
we see, 
that for every point $x \in \speD$, the point $x - \frac{1}{2}$ is an acccumulation point. 
Let us observe, that also, for every point $x \in \speD$, we have that $x - \frac{1}{2} 
\in \speD$, 
because $\Delta(^\ast \infty) = -\frac{1}{2}$. 
\end{observation}
%Now we will show that the order type of $\speD$ is $\omega^\omega$ and where exactly are 
%its accumulation points of which orders. For this we will use  
%a handful of lemmas. 

%\subsubsection{Finiteness lemma}
\begin{lemma}\label{finiteness_lemma}
For all $n \in \mathbb{N}_{\geq 2}$ and $x \in (-\infty, 1]$ there are only finitely 
many Euler orbicharacteristics
in the interval $[x,1] \cap \speD$ of orbifolds that have points of order equal 
at most $n$. 
\end{lemma}
\textbf{Proof.} 

Let $x \in (-\infty, 1]$. There can be at most $\lfloor 4(1-x) \rfloor$ orbipoints on the 
$D^2$ orbifold 
with an \Eoc\ $y \in [x,1]$ since each orbipoint decreases an \Eoc\ by at least $\frac{1}{4}$ 
and the Euler characteristic of $D^2$ is $1$. 

There are only $(n-1)^{\lfloor 4(1-x) \rfloor}$ possible sets of $\lfloor 4(1-x) \rfloor$ 
orbipoints' orders that are less or equal than $n$. Hence, there are only at most 
$(n-1)^{\lfloor 4(1-x) \rfloor}$ possible \Eoc s.


\begin{lemma}\label{first_order_lemma}
If $x$ is an acccumulation point of the set $\speD$ of order $n$, then $x-\frac{1}{2}$ is a
 accumulation point of the set $\speD$ of order at least $n+1$. 
\end{lemma}
\noindent\textbf{Proof.} \\
Inductive. 

$\bullet$ $n = 0$: If $x$ is an isolated point of the set $\speD$, then $x \in \speD$. 
From that, we 
have, that points $x - \frac{k-1}{2k}$ are in $\speD$ for all $k \geq 1$, from that, that 
$x-\frac{1}{2}$ is a 
accumulation point of $\speD$. 

$\bullet$ inductive step: Let $x$ be an acccumulation point of the set $\speD$ of an order 
$n > 0$. 
Let $a_k$ be a sequence of accumulation points of order $n-1$ convergent to $x$. From the 
inductive assumption, we have, that $a_k - \frac{1}{2}$ is a sequence of accumulation points 
of order at least $n$. From the basic sequence arithmetic it is convergent to $x-\frac{1}{2}$. 
From that, we have that $x-\frac{1}{2}$ is an acccumulation point of the set $\speD$ of order 
at least $n+1$. $_\square$
\begin{lemma}\label{second_order_lemma}
If $x$ is an acccumulation point of the set $\speD$ of order $n$, then $x+\frac{1}{2}$ is 
an acccumulation point of the set $\speD$ of order at least $n-1$.  
\end{lemma}
\noindent\textbf{Proof.} \\  
Inductive 

$\bullet$ $n = 1$: We assume, that $x$ is an acccumulation point of isolated points of the set 
$\speD$. 
%Let us observe
From \ref{finiteness_lemma} we know, that for all $m$ there are only finitely many 
Euler orbicharacteristics 
in the interval $[x,1]$ of orbifolds that have dihedral points of order equal at most $m$. \\ 
%\todo{może to dać jako osobny lemat}
From that, for arbitrary small neighborhood $U \ni x$ and arbitrary large $m$ there exist 
an orbifold 
that has a dihedral point of period grater than $m$, whose Euler orbicharacteristic lies in $U$. 
Let us take a sequence of such \Eoc s $a_k$ convergent to $x$, such that we can choose 
a sequence divergent to infinity of periods of dihedral points $b_k$ of orbifolds of \Eoc s 
equal $a_k$. 
\smalltodoII{picture} 
Let us observe, that for all $k$, the number $a_k+\frac{b_k-1}{2b_k}$ is in $\speD$. 
It is so, because $a_k$ is an \Eoc\ of an orbifold that have a dihedral point of period $b_k$, so 
identical orbifold, only without this dihedral point, has an \Eoc\ equal to $a_k + 
\frac{b_k-1}{2b_k}$. 
The sequence $a_k + \frac{b_k-1}{2b_k}$ converge to $x+\frac{1}{2}$. From that we have, that 
$x + \frac{1}{2}$ is an acccumulation point of the set $\speD$ of order at least $0$. \\
$\bullet$ inductive step: Let $x$ be an acccumulation point of the set $\speD$ of order $n > 1$. 
Let $a_k$ be a sequence of accumulation points of the set $\speD$ of order $n-1$ 
convergent to $x$. 
From the inductive assumption the sequence $a_k + \frac{1}{2}$ is a sequence of an acccumulation
 points of the set $\speD$ of order $n-2$ convergent to $x + \frac{1}{2}$. From that 
 $x + \frac{1}{2}$ is an acccumulation point of the set $\speD$ of order at least 
 $n-1$. $_\square$ 
\begin{lemma}\label{third_order_lemma}
If $x$ is an acccumulation point of the set $\speD$ of order $n+1$, then \\
$x - \frac{1}{2}$ is an acccumulation point of the set $\speD$ of order $n+2$ and \\
$x + \frac{1}{2}$ is an acccumulation point of the set $\speD$ of order $n$. 
\end{lemma}
\noindent\textbf{Proof.} 

Let $x$ be an acccumulation point of the set $\speD$ of order $n+1$. From the lemma 
 \ref{first_order_lemma} we know, that $x - \frac{1}{2}$ is an acccumulation point of the set 
 $\speD$ of order at least $n+2$. Now let us assume (for a contradiction), that $x - \frac{1}{2}$ 
 is an \apots $\speD$ of order $k>n+2$. But then from the lemma \ref{second_order_lemma} 
 we have that $x$ is an acccumulation point of the set $\speD$ of order at least $n+2$ and that 
 is a contradiction. 
 
Analogously, from the lemma \ref{second_order_lemma} we know, that $x + \frac{1}{2}$ is a 
accumulation point of the set $\speD$ of order at least $n$. Let us assume (for a contradiction), 
that $x+ \frac{1}{2}$ is an acccumulation point of the set $\speD$ of order $k>n$. But then 
from the lemma \ref{first_order_lemma} we have that $x$ is an acccumulation point of 
the set $\speD$ 
of order at least $n+2$ and that is a contradiction. $_\square$ 
\begin{lemma}\label{accumulation_points_of_the_set}
For all $n \in \mathbb{N}$ all accumulation points of the set $\speD$ of order $n$ are in $\speD$.
\end{lemma}
\noindent\textbf{Proof.} \\
Inductive 

$\bullet$ $n=0$: Clear, as they are isolated points of $\speD$. 

$\bullet$ inductive step: Let $x$ be a \apots\  $\speD$ of order $n>0$. From the lemma 
\ref{third_order_lemma} point $x+\frac{1}{2}$ is an acccumulation point of the set $\speD$  
of order $n-1$. From the inductive assumption $x+\frac{1}{2} \in \speD$. Then, 
from \ref{accumulation_points_are_in_the_spectrum}, we have that $x \in \speD$. 
$_\square$ 

\begin{theorem}\label{greatest \apots}
The greatest \apots\ $\speD$ of order $n$ is $1-\frac{n}{2}$.
\end{theorem}
\noindent\textbf{Proof.}\\
Inductive 

$\bullet$ $n=0$: We know, that $1\in \speD$ and $1$ is the greatest element of $\speD$. 

$\bullet$ an inductive step: From the inductive assumption we know that $1-\frac{n}{2}$ is 
the greatest \apots\ $\speD$ of order $n$. From the lemma \ref{third_order_lemma} we have then 
that $1-\frac{n+1}{2}$ is a \apots\ $\speD$ of order $n+1$. Let us assume (for a contradiction), 
that there exist a bigger accumulation point of order $n+1$ equal to $y > 1-\frac{n+1}{2}$. 
But then, from lemma \ref{third_order_lemma}, point $y+\frac{1}{2}$ would be an acccumulation 
point 
of order $n$, what gives a contradiction, because $y+\frac{1}{2}>1-\frac{n}{2}$. $_\square$ 
\\[8pt]
From the above discussion we can also formulate following corollary that will be useful later: 
% corollary (stated in for deifferent ways 
%as one are sometimes more useful that another): 
%\begin{corollary}\label{predescors}
%Let $x \in \spe$. Then there exists $n \in \mathbb{N}$ such that $x + \frac{n}{2} \in \spe$ 
%but $x+\frac{n+1}{2} \not\in \spe$. For such $n$ we have that $x$ is an \apots\ $\spe$ of 
%order $n$.  
%\end{corollary}
%\begin{corollary}
%\end{corollary}
%%Above corollary can be refolmulated in a way that sometimes is more useful:
%\begin{corollary}\label{predescors_variant_II}
%Let $x \in \spe$ be an \apots\ $\spe$ of order $n$. Then there is $y \in \spe$ that is 
%an isolated point of $\spe$ such that $x = y - \frac{n}{2}$.   
%\end{corollary}
\begin{corollary}\label{predescors}
Let $x \in \speD$. Then:
\begin{itemize}
\item there exists $n_1 \in \mathbb{N}$ such that $x + \frac{n_1}{2} \in \speD$ 
but $x+\frac{n_1+1}{2} \not\in \speD$. 

In other words, there exist $y \in \speD$ and 
$n_1 \in \mathbb{N}$ such that 
$y + \frac{1}{2} \not\in \speD$ and such that $x = y - \frac{n_1}{2}$;
\item there exists $n_2 \in \mathbb{N}$ such that $x$ is an \apots\ $\speD$ of 
order $n_2$
%\item $x$ is an \apots\ $\speD$ of order $n_2$, for some $n_2 \in \mathbb{N}$;  
\end{itemize}
and $n_1 = n_2$.
\end{corollary}

\subsection{Proof that $\speD$ is well ordered}

\begin{definition} 
Let $B_0 = \{1\}$.
For an $n \in \mathbb{N}_{>0}$, let $B_n$ be the set of all possible \Eoc\ realised 
by orbifolds of type 
$*^*b_1, \cdots, ^*b_n$. For a given $n$ these are 
$D^2$ orbifolds with precisely $n$ non trivial orbipoits on their boundry.
\end{definition}


\begin{observation}\label{recursive_relation}
There is a recursive relation, that $B_{n+1}=B_n+\{-\frac{n-1}{2n}\ |\ n\geq 2\}$
\end{observation}
\textbf{Proof.} \\
It is so, because every orbifold with $n+1$ orbipoints can be obtained by adding one point

\begin{observation}\label{form_of_a_spectrum}
Observe that, as any orbifold has only finitely many orbipoints, we have that $\speD \subseteq 
\bigcup\limits^\infty_{n=0}B_n $. We defined $\speD$ as a set of all possible \Eoc\ of disk 
orbifolds, so $\speD \supseteq 
\bigcup\limits^\infty_{n=0}B_n $. From this we have that $\speD = \bigcup\limits^\infty_{n=0}B_n$.
\end{observation}

\begin{lemma}\label{fixed_number_of_orbipoints}
For any given $n \in \mathbb{N}$ the set $B_n$ is a subset of the interval 
$[1-\frac{n}{2}, 1-\frac{n}{4}]$.
\end{lemma}
\textbf{Proof.} \\
Take $x \in B_n$. There exists an orbifold $O$ with signature $\ast ^*b_1, \cdots, ^*b_n$, 
such that $\cho{O} = x$. We have that $\forall_i -\frac{1}{2} \leq \Delta(^*b_i) \leq 
-\frac{1}{4}$. From this $-\frac{n}{2} \leq \Delta(^*b_1, \cdots, ^*b_n) \leq -\frac{n}{4}$, 
so $\cho{O} \in [1-\frac{n}{2}, 1-\frac{n}{4}]$. $_\square$

\begin{observation}\label{ascending_in_B_n}
From \ref{recursive_relation} and \ref{two_sets_lemma}, we have that $B_n$ do not have 
infinite ascending sequence for all $n$. 

Further, from \ref{sum_lemma} we conclude, 
that $\bigcup\limits_{n=0}^N B_n$ do not have infinite ascending sequence for all $N$.
\end{observation}

\begin{theorem}\label{well_order}
In $\speD$ there are no infinite strictly ascending sequences, hence, it is well ordered.
\end{theorem}
\noindent\textbf{Proof.} \\
%Being well ordered is a consequence of not having infinite strictly ascending sequences. 
For the sake of contradiction lets assume that $c_n$ is an infinite strictly ascending sequence in 
$\speD$. As $c_n$ is bounded from below by $c_0$ and whole $\speD$ is bounded from above 
by $1$, all elements of $c_n$ are in the interval $[c_0, 1]$. 
From \ref{form_of_a_spectrum} we have, that $\speD = \bigcup\limits^\infty_{n=0}B_n$. 

Lemma 
\ref{fixed_number_of_orbipoints} says that for all $n$ we
have $B_n \subset [1-\frac{n}{2}, 1 - \frac{n}{4}]$. From this, we know, that for any 
$n$ such that $1 - \frac{n}{4} < c_0$ 
we have, that $B_n \cap [c_0,1] = \varnothing $. Let $n_0$ be the smallest such that 
$1 - \frac{n_0}{4} < c_0$ (so $n_0 > 4(1-c_0)$). 
Then for all $n > n_0$ we have $1 - \frac{n}{4} < c_0$, meaning, that 
for all $n > n_0$ we have
$B_n \cap [c_0,1] = \varnothing $, so all elements of $c_n$ are in 
$\bigcup\limits_{n=0}^{n_0} B_n$.
But this contradicts \ref{ascending_in_B_n}.  $_\square$

\subsection{Proof that order structure and topology of $\speD$ are those of $\omega^\omega$}
%\smalltodoII{rozbić to na dwa?} 
\begin{theorem}\label{speD_order_type}
Order type and topology of $\speD$ is $\omega^\omega$. 
\end{theorem}
\textbf{Proof.} 
%that order type of $\speD$ is $\omega^\omega$: \\
%- proof that it is at least $\omega^\omega$ \\

We will first prove, that the order type of $\speD$ is $\omega^\omega$.

$\bullet$ Order type of $\speD$ is at least $\omega^\omega$.

%For the sake of contradiction, let us suppouse that the order type $\eta$ of $\speD$ 
%is less than $\omega^\omega$. Then $\eta$ is smaller than $\omega^n$ for some $n$. 
%However, 
From \ref{greatest \apots} we know, that for every $n\in \mathbb{N}$, in $\speD$ there are 
accumulation points of order $n$. From this, and from \ref{accumulation_points_and_order} 
we know that $\speD$ has an order type at least $\omega^n$, for all $n\in \mathbb{N}$. 
The smallest ordinal number qual at least $\omega^n$, for all $n \in \mathbb{N}$ is 
$\omega^\omega$. Thus, the order type of $\speD$ is at least $\omega^\omega$.\\
% but for sufficiently distant have accumulation point. \\
%done \\

$\bullet$ Order type of $\speD$ is at most $\omega^\omega$.

%- proof that it is at most $\omega^\omega$\\
For the sake of contradiction, let us suppouse, that the order type $\eta$ of $\speD$ is 
strictly greater than $\omega^\omega$. Then, $\speD$ has a set $A$ of an order type 
$\omega^\omega$ as it's prefix. The set $A$ is bounded, as the $\omega^\omega+1$st element of 
$\speD$ is greater than any alement of $A$. 
Let $n$, be such that $1-\frac{n}{2}$ is smaller than any lement of $A$. 
As $A$ is of order type $\omega^\omega$ it has a prefix $B$ of order type $\omega^n$.
From \ref{accumulation_points_and_order} we know, that $B$ has an accumulation point $b$ 
of order $n$. This gives us a contradiction, as $b > 1-\frac{n}{2}$, and from \ref{greatest \apots} 
we know, that $1-\frac{n}{2}$ is the greatest accumulation point of order $n$ in $\speD$. \\

%suppouse it is bigger \\
%then there is a point before which there is omega omega order \\
%wooo, but it cant be since first with accumulation is at something spmething \\

%ok, so how to give convincing correspondence between accumulation points and $\omega^n$??

Now, we will prove, that the topology of $\speD$ is that of $\omega^\omega$.

From \ref{accumulation_points_of_the_set} we know that every accumulation point 
of $\speD$ is in $\speD$. 
%We just showed, that the order type of $\speD$ is $\omega^\omega$.
Thus, $\speD$ satisfies the assumtions of the lemma \ref{order_preserving_homeomorphism_theorem}

\section{Order type and topology of $\spebr{M}$}\label{all_spectra_are_isomorphic}\label{spe_M}

\begin{observation}\label{2times homeomerphism}
We have that $\speS = 2\speD$.
\end{observation}
\textbf{Proof.}\\

Indeed, since: \todo{write the sums}

\begin{observation}
For every two dimentional manifold $M$, we have that $\spe(M)$ is homeomorphic to $\speS$. 
For $M$ with $h$ handles, $c$ cross-cups and $b$ boundary components, this homeomorphism is: \\
$\bullet$ for $b \neq 0$:
\begin{equation}
\spe(M) = \speD - 2h - c - (b - 1), 
\end{equation}
$\bullet$ for $b = 0$:
\begin{equation}
\spe(M) = 2\speD - 2h - c.
\end{equation}  
\end{observation}

%Ok, all isomorphic with $\speD$ \\
%here write about it \\
%Tell me about it!
\textbf{Proof.} \\
For a manifold $M$ with $h$ handles, $c$ cross-cups and $b$ boundary components, it's 
Euler characteristic is given by:
\begin{equation}
\chi(M) = 2-2h-c-b.
\end{equation}
The possible $\Delta$ for possible orbifold features are:\\
$\bullet$ for $b\neq 0$:
\begin{equation}
\{-\frac{n-1}{2n}\ \big|\ n\in\mathbb{N}_{>0}\cup \{\infty\}\}
\end{equation}
$\bullet$ for $b = 0$:
\begin{equation}
\{-\frac{n-1}{n}\ \big|\ n\in\mathbb{N}_{>0}\cup \{\infty\}\}.
\end{equation} 
%with the convention, that $\varphi(\infty) \coloneqq \lim\limits_{k\to \infty} \varphi(k)$.

Thus, we have that:\\
$\bullet$ for $b\neq 0$: 
\begin{equation}
\spe(M) = 2-2h-c-b - \left\{\sum\limits_{i=1}^n\frac{d_i-1}{2d_i}\ 
\big|\ n\in\mathbb{N}_0,\ d_i\in\mathbb{N}_{>0}\cup \{\infty\}\right\}
\end{equation}
$\bullet$ for $b = 0$:
\begin{equation}
\spe(M) = 2-2h-c - \left\{\sum\limits_{i=1}^n \frac{r_i-1}{r_i}\ \big|\ n\in\mathbb{N}_0,\ 
r_i\in\mathbb{N}_{>0}\cup \{\infty\}\right\}.
\end{equation} 

On the other hand, we have that:
\begin{equation}
\speD = 1-\left\{\sum\limits_{i=1}^n\frac{d_i-1}{2d_i}\ 
\big|\ n\in\mathbb{N}_0,\ d_i\in\mathbb{N}_{>0}\cup \{\infty\}\right\}
\end{equation}
\begin{equation}
\speS = 2 - \left\{\sum\limits_{i=1}^n \frac{r_i-1}{r_i}\ \big|\ n\in\mathbb{N}_0,\ 
r_i\in\mathbb{N}_{>0}\cup \{\infty\}\right\}
\end{equation}
and
\begin{equation}
\speS = 2\speD.
\end{equation}
From this, the observation follows immedietly. $_\square$

\section{Order type and topology of $\spe$}
\begin{theorem}
The order type of the set of possible Euler orbicharacteristics of two-dimensional orbifolds 
$\spe$ is $\omega^\omega$. 
\end{theorem}
\textbf{Proof.} \\
From \ref{sum of spectras} we know, that $\spe = \speD \cup \speS$.

From \ref{speD_order_type} and \ref{2times homeomerphism}, we have that order types and 
topologies of $\speD$ and $\speS$ both are $\omega^\omega$ and that $\speS = 2\speD$.  

We will now prove that the order type of $\spe$ is $\omega^\omega$.

From \ref{greatest \apots} we know, that the largest \apots\ $\speD$\ of order $n$ is 
$1-\frac{n}{2}$. From, this and from the fact that $\speS = 2\speD$ we know that 
that the largest \apots\ $\speS$\ of order $n$ is 
$2-n$. From this, we have, that for every $m \in \mathbb{N}_{>0}$, order type of 
$(-m, \infty) \cap \speD$ is $\omega^{2m+2}$ and that order type 
of $(-m, \infty) \cap \speS$ is $\omega^{m+2}$. 
%So, for every $m \in \mathbb{N}_{>0}$, the order type of $\speD$ is strictly greater than 
%th
Thus, for every $m \in \mathbb{N}_{>0}$, we have that $(-m, \infty) \cap \speD$ and 
$(-m, \infty) \cap \speS$ satisfies assumtions of \ref{key_lemma}, thus, we have that 
$(-m, \infty) \cap (\speD\cup\speS)$ have an order type $\omega^{2m+2}$. 

From this we have that 
\begin{equation}
\spe = \speD \cup \speS = 
\bigcup\limits_{m=1}^\infty \left( (-m, \infty) \cap (\speD\cup\speS) \right)
\end{equation} 
have an order type $\omega^\omega$.

Now we will prove, that the topology of $\spe$ is that of $\omega^\omega$ too.

We have that for $\speD$ \rba{$\speS$} that every accumulation point of 
$\speD$ \rba{$\speS$} is in $\speD$ \rba{$\speS$}. From this and from 
\ref{derivative and sum is commutative} we have, that all accumulations points of $\spe$ 
are in $\spe$. From this, from lemma \ref{order_preserving_homeomorphism_theorem} we have 
that the topology of $\spe$ is $\omega^\omega$. $_\square$

%$\speS = 2\speD$, so for all $n\in \mathbb{N}$ set $\speS \cap [2,-n)$ has a lower order type then 
%$\speD\cap [2,-n)$. From this and from \ref{sum_lemma}, we have that $\speS \cup \speD$ 
%has an order type of $\omega^\omega$. \\
%For homeomorphicity, the proof of theorem \ref{speD_theorem} works as well in this case.

\section{More about how this $\spe$, $\speD$ and $\speS$ lie in $\mathbb{R}$}
%\todo{movve to some other section maybe}
\begin{observation}
The first (greatest) negative \apots\ of $\spe$ is 
$-\frac{1}{12}$. It is the accumulation point of order $1$. 
\end{observation}
\noindent\textbf{Proof.} 

We will show, that $-\frac{1}{12}$ is the greatest negative accumulation point of the set $\speD$. 
From this we will obtain the thesis, as the set of all possible Euler orbicharacteristics 
of two-dimensional orbifolds is equal to $\speS \cup \speD$ and $\speS = 2\speD$, so 
the greatest negative point of the set $\speS$ is smaller than the greatest negative accumulation 
point of the set $\speD$. 

$\bullet$ $-\frac{1}{12}=\chi^{orb}((2,3))-\frac{1}{2}$, from this we have that $-\frac{1}{12}$ 
an acccumulation point of the set $\speD$ of order at least $1$. 

$\bullet$ Let us assume (for a contradiction), that there exist bigger, negative 
accumulation point of the set $\speD$ of order at least $1$. Let us denote it by $x$. 

However, then, from the lemma \ref{third_order_lemma} point $x+\frac{1}{2}$ is the accumulation 
point of the set $\speD$. What is more, since $x\in (0, -\frac{1}{12})$, then $x+\frac{1}{2} 
\in (\frac{1}{2}, \frac{5}{12}$. From the lemma \ref{accumulation_points_of_the_set} we 
have that $x$ is in $\speD$. But orbifolds of the type $\ast b_1$ can have \Eoc only greater or 
equal $\frac{1}{2}$. Orbifolds of the type $\ast b_1b_2$ can only have \Eoc $\frac{1}{2}$, 
$\frac{5}{12}$ and some smaller. Orbifolds of the type $\ast b_1b_2b_3\cdots$ can have \Eoc only 
lower than $\frac{1}{4}$. This analysis of the cases leads us to the conclusion, that 
$(\frac{1}{2},\frac{5}{12})\cap \speD=\emptyset$ and to the contradiction. 

$\bullet$ Above analysis of the cases leads us also to the conclusion, that $\frac{5}{12}$ 
is 
an isolated point of the set $\speD$, from this $-\frac{1}{12}$ is an acccumulation point 
of order $1$ of the set $\speD$. $_\square$ \\ 
 
\subsection{Connections between $\speD$ and $\speS$}\label{D_and_S}
In this section we would like to 
%develop the tools and 
answer some questions about 
%interrelationships
relations between $\speD$ and $\speS$. 

The first, stated in \ref{} is that $2\speD=\speS$. 
This tells us all about simmilarities of their topological structures -- namely, 
they are the same, 
but it does not directly answers questions about how they lie in $\mathbb{R}$, relative 
to each other.

$2-n(2-x)\in \speS$}
for all $n \in \mathbb{N}$.

%\subsection{All the accumulation points of the $\speS$ are in $\speD$}
\subsubsection{Accumulation points of the $\speS$}
\begin{theorem}
All accumulation points of the $\speS$ are in $\speD$.
\end{theorem}
There are two proofs of this theorem showing nice correnpondence -- one arithmetical and 
one geometrical. 
\\
\textbf{Proof I.}
%\subsubsection{Arithmetical reason}
\textbf{Arithmetical reason} \\
We assume that $x \in \speS$ is an \apots\ $\speS$.\\
%If $x \in \speS$, then $\frac{x}{2} \in \speD$. Then $1 - \frac{x}{2}$ 
%is a difference in \Eoc\ resulting from some set of cone points. We can add to the disc twice as 
%many cone points and resulting orbifold $\mathcal{O}$ will have an \Eoc\ equal to 
%$1 - 2(1-\frac{x}{2}) = x - 1$. From \ref{third_order_lemma} for the thesis it is sufficient 
%to $x - 1$ to be an \apots\ $\speD$ of order at least two. \\
%%$2-x$ is a difference in \Eoc\ resulting from some set of gyration points. We can 
%We asumed that $x \in \speS$ is an \apots\ $\speS$, so, 
By \ref{times_two_fact} we have, that 
$\frac{x}{2} \in \speD$ is an \apots\ $\speD$. From \ref{third_order_lemma} we have that 
$\frac{x}{2} + \frac{1}{2} \in \speD$. From that, from \ref{adding_multiplied_differences} 
we have, 
that \begin{equation}
1-\overbrace{2}^{\substack{"n"\rm\ from\ \\ 
\rm \ref{adding_multiplied_differences}}} 
(\ \overbrace{1-(\frac{x}{2}+\frac{1}{2})}^{\substack{"1-x"\rm\ 
from\ \\ \rm \ref{adding_multiplied_differences}}}\ ) \in \speD.
\end{equation} 
But $1 - 2(1-(\frac{x}{2}+
\frac{1}{2})) = x$, so $x \in \speD$. $_\square$
% for some $y \in \speD$, so $\speD$.
\\[2pt]
\textbf{Proof II.}
%\subsubsection{Geometrical reason}
\textbf{Geometrical reason} \\
We assume that $x \in \speS$ is an \apots\ $\speS$.\\
%If $x \in \speS$
From \ref{predescors} we know, that $x$ can be expressed as $y - 1$ for some $y \in \speS$. \\
Let $\mathcal{O}$ be an orbifold with the base manifold $S^2$, such that $\cho{\mathcal{O}} 
= y$. \\
Let $\mathcal{O}_c$ be the orbifold created from $\mathcal{O}$ by adding one cusp. 
Then $\cho{\mathcal{O}_c} = y - 1 = x$. Topologically $\mathcal{O}_c$ with the cusp point 
removed (which do not change an orbicharacteristic) is $\mathbb{R}^2$. 
We can compactify it with $S^1$. This will not change an \Eoc\ since $\cho{S^1} = 0$ and 
\Eoc\ is additive.
\\ What we get is an orbifold $\mathcal{O}_D$ with the base 
manifold $D^2$ and the same 
orbipoints as $\mathcal{O}$. Since orbipoints of $\mathcal{O}$ create a difference 
in \Eoc\ equal to $2-y$, we have that $\cho{\mathcal{O}_D} = 1 - (2-y) = y - 1 = x$. 
We can then move all orbipoints from the interior of $\mathcal{O}_D$ to its boundry 
by doubling them, so $x \in \speD$. $_\square$\\



%The first equstion we can tackle is steaming from the chapter \ref{order structure} 
%and it is -- 
Do $\speD$ and $\speS$ coincide? It is easy to answer that $\speD \neq \speS$ 
(and we will do that along some harder questions in the moment), but do they coincide 
starting from a sufficiently distant point? Or maybe, for every denominator, do they coincide 
from a sufficiently distatn point? (Yes.) \\
